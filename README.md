# Moon Design System

This project was an opportunity for me to learn the process between design and development production. I handled a Figma file that described desired styles and props, and was able to create those component designs as developed components that can be used in other projects. 

- Developed 20 React components for external use after being made available from design team
- Incorporated component styling to reflect fidelity of Figma design system files, including dark and light themes
- Implemented all requested props and used Storybook to display functionality
